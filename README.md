🧠 Smart Vocab Builder

Learn languages faster by reading what you love. Vocabulary-Learner helps you mine real-world texts (news, stories, or even movie subtitles) for useful vocabulary and builds rich, interactive learning cards — all tailored to your level.

People learn best from content they actually care about. Instead of memorizing random word lists, read or watch something real and let the app intelligently extract the most relevant expressions for you, so you can focus on what truly moves the needle.

✨ Key Features
🎯 Level-Aware Extraction (A1–C1)

Analyzes long texts (e.g., news, stories, or .srt subtitle files) and pulls out the most practical words, idioms, and phrases for your exact proficiency level.

✍️ Word-List Mode

Already have a list? Paste it in (one item per line or separated by “–”) and get detailed analyses for exactly those terms.

🧠 Rich Learning Cards

Each vocabulary item becomes a structured card containing:

Translation into your native language

Simple, level-appropriate definition

Grammar details (part of speech, key rules, special notes)

Common collocations

Real-world examples with native translations

Notes on common mistakes & usage context

Pronunciation guide (IPA or phonetic transcription)

Helpful tags (e.g., idiom, phrasal-verb, frequency-high)

🗣️ Text-to-Speech

Listen to the correct pronunciation of each vocabulary item and its example sentences.

🌍 Multi-Language Support

The UI is fully localized — supports 9+ languages (Persian, English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, Italian, Russian) — and automatically adjusts for RTL/LTR layouts.

🌓 Modern UI

A clean, elegant interface with Light/Dark themes and smooth transitions.

🚀 Quick Start

This project is 100% front-end (HTML, CSS, JS) — no backend setup required beyond the free proxy worker.

Open the app (e.g., via GitHub Pages or any static host).

Select your native language, target language, and level (if analyzing a text).

Paste your text or word list.

Click Analyze and start learning.

⚙️ How It Works

Two input modes:

Analyze a Text – Paste a long text (article, book excerpt, or subtitle file) and select your proficiency level (e.g., B1).
The AI scans the text and extracts only the vocabulary that’s most relevant for that level — skipping words that are too simple or too advanced.

Use Your Own List – Paste a custom list of words or phrases (one per line or separated by “–”) and check “This is a word list.”
The app generates a detailed analysis for every single item. No level selection required.

🧩 Philosophy

Vocabulary-Learner was built to make language learning natural and meaningful — turning the content you already read or watch into personalized, level-appropriate practice.
Less rote memorization, more real-world language.
